GOAL: Design a system of automatic controller commands
REQS:
  - behaviour should be driven by environmental context
  - if something (a box) is in the environment
    - and i see it
      - i may get it's list of interactions and select one
        - if i'm not within required interaction distance,
          - walk until i am
  - Interactions
    - Controller for other Objs
  - Behaviors
    - Controller for Autonomy
    - Controller for Player

  - Inanimate Objs
    - Interactions
  - Animate Objs
    - Interactions
    - Behaviors




- Animate Wave
  - Just an arm movement
- How to mask animation with Unity?
  - arm waving shouldn't interrupt walk



## SensoryOverride
- Can I decide to wave if i'm already walking?
  - Sensory Override
    - Happen at Commander Level
      - i.e. if(sensory override)StartCoroutine()
